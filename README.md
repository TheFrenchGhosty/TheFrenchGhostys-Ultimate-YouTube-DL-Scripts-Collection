## Installation (Linux):

Install [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (optionally, install the others [yt-dlp dependencies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#dependencies)).

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/TheFrenchGhosty/TheFrenchGhostys-YouTube-DL-Archivist-Scripts/releases) and follow the included ReadMe, do not use the `master` branch unless you are ready to re-download EVERYTHING.

---

## Installation (Windows):

The Windows version, while it existed, required a lot of work to maintain because it needed specific changes compared to the linux version, and was never extensively tested. Windows users need to use the scripts in WSL, Cygwin, Git Bash, or some other Linux-on-Windows environment that enables Bash functionality in Windows.
 
Installation using WSL (recommended): [Here](docs/WSL.md)

Installation using Cygwin, Git Bash or similar: [Here](docs/Cygwin-Git-Bash.md)

Downloaded videos will likely exceed Windows' 260-character path length limit and not be playable out of the box. You should read more about [paths](docs/About-Paths.md) to familiarize yourself with the issue, as well as some potential workarounds.

---

## Usage: 

Create a folder where you want your videos downloaded in a drive where you have enough space available.

Put the folders `Archivist Scripts`, `Audio-Only Scripts` and `Watch Scripts` in the created folder (See the documentation to understand the differences).

Add content to a 'Source - XXXXXX.txt' file depending of what type of content you want to download (See the documentation to understand the differences).

Open a terminal in the folder of the script you want to use and run `./[SCRIPT].sh`.

Done.
